# Sugarcane-target-enrichment-analysis
To characterize natural variations in ‘Saccharum complex’, a target enrichment sequencing approach was used to assay 12 representative germplasm accessions. In total, 55,946 highlyhigh efficient probes were designed based on the sorghum genome and sugarcane unigene set targeting a total of 6 Mb of the sugarcane genome. A pipeline specifically tailored for polyploid sequence variants and genotype calling was described.
